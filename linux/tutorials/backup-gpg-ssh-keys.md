# Setup SSH keys
## Generate new SSH key
1. Run the following command
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```
    This creates a public key (`id_rsa.pub`) and a private key (`id_rsa`) in your ~/.ssh/ directory.
2. Now your private key to the `ssh-agent` by running the following commands:
    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
## Restore existing SSH keys:
1. Copy `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` to ~/.ssh on remote computer
2. Now your private key to the `ssh-agent` by running the following commands:
    ```bash
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
# Use SSH key for password-less login to `remote`
1. From the guest run:
    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remoteid@remote-ip
    ```
2. To fix permission of **`.ssh`** directory on `remote`, login using password. Then run
    ```bash
    chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

## Generate and Restore/Port GnuPG PGP keys:

1. Generate pgp key:
    1. run in terminal:
        ```bash
        gpg --full-generate-key
        ```
    2. At the prompt, specify the kind of key you want, or press `Enter` to accept the default and best `RSA and RSA`.
    3. Enter the desired key size. Your key must be at least **4096** bits.
    4. Enter the validity of key. Best practice is **365 days** or **1 year**.
    5. Enter your name and mail-id
    6. Type a strong passphrase.
    7. Save your **passphrase** in a password manager(eg. Firefox/Google/MS authenticator)[Very important]
    8. Set proper permission to `~/.gnupg`:
        ```bash
        find ~/.gnupg -type d -exec chmod 700 {} \;
        find ~/.gnupg -type f -exec chmod 600 {} \;
        ```
2. Same PGP keys can be used on multiple systems or can be restored in case of system failure.
    1. Backup your PGP keys:
        1. Check generated keys:
            ```bash
            gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
            ```
            Sample output:
            ```bash
            sec     rsa4096/XXXXEFC47549XXXX 2020-12-07 [SC] [expires: 2022-01-01]
                    XXXX9D769D1647CA5687F9D5XXXXEFC47549XXXX
            uid                 [ultimate] HIMADRI SEKHAR BASU (pgp on 07-12-2020) <hsb10@iitbbs.ac.in>
            ssb     rsa4096/XXXX36324DA6XXXX 2020-12-07 [E] [expires: 2022-01-01]
            ```
            where, in `rsa4096/XXXXEFC47549XXXX`, `XXXXEFC47549XXXX` is the `key-id`. This is the last `16` character of the `40` character fingerprint in second line.
        2. To back-up the private key with `key-id: XXXXEFC47549XXXX`:
            ```bash
            gpg --armor --export-secret-keys XXXXEFC47549XXXX > /path/to/key/XXXXEFC47549XXXX.asc
            ```
        3. Copy the `XXXXEFC47549XXXX.asc` to another machine or save it somewhere safe for future use.
    2. To restore/reuse on a system:
        1. copy the `XXXXEFC47549XXXX.asc` and run:
           ```bash
           gpg --import XXXXEFC47549XXXX.asc
           ```
           and enter the passphrase you used to generate the key.
        2. Check the pgp keys:
            ```bash
            gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
            ```
            Sample output:
            ```bash
            sec     rsa4096/XXXXEFC47549XXXX 2020-12-07 [SC] [expires: 2022-01-01]
                    XXXX9D769D1647CA5687F9D5XXXXEFC47549XXXX
            uid                 [unknown] HIMADRI SEKHAR BASU (pgp on 07-12-2020) <hsb10@iitbbs.ac.in>
            ssb     rsa4096/XXXX36324DA6XXXX 2020-12-07 [E] [expires: 2022-01-01]
            ```
        3. If you didnâ€™t back up your trust database, the restored GPG key will have an `unknown` trust level. To set it to `ultimate` or another trust level, run the following command:
            ```bash
            gpg --edit-key XXXXEFC47549XXXX # Replace "XXXXEFC47549XXXX" with yours
            gpg> trust # Choose "ultimate" or other trust level
            gpg> save # Save the changes
            ```
    Now you have fully restored the pgp key.
