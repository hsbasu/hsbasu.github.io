				<p>I am Himadri Sekhar Basu. At present, I am working as a JRF at <a href='http://www.iitbbs.ac.in/'>Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar</a>. I went to <a href='http://jgec.ac.in/'>Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College</a> for my graduation in Mechanical Engineering from 2010 to 2014. I joined <a href='http://www.iitbbs.ac.in/'>IIT Bhubaneswar</a> as post-graduate student in Thermal Science and Engineering in 2015. After completing my M.Tech. in June,2017, I joined here as a JRF.</p>
				<p>My career objective is to utilize my potential skills and knowledge, as a research scholar, in the best possible way towards the betterment and development of humanity by joining a research institute. To achieve this, in the near future, I want to acquire more knowledge on flow through microchannels. So, I am planning to join a doctoral program, where I can deepen my knowledge on this topic.</p>
				<p>My research interest includes, but not limited to, Microfluidics, Electrokinetics, Flow Instabilities, Turbulence, Non-conventional Energy, Fuel cell, Heat Transfer, Experimental, and Numerical techniques in Fluid Mechanics.</p>
				<p>I have hands on experience in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Boltzmann_methods'> <!--href='https://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/physics.ndsu.edu/Wagner/LBbook.pdf'-->
				lattice Boltzmann method</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrokinetic_phenomena'>electrokinetics</a>, and lattice Boltzmann modelling of electrokinetic instabilities.</p>
